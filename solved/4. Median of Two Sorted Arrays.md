## Description

>There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
>
>Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
>
>You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.
>
>>Example 1:
>>
>>nums1 = [1, 3]  
>>nums2 = [2]  
>>The median is 2.0  
>
>>Example 2:
>>
>>nums1 = [1, 2]  
>>nums2 = [3, 4]  
>>The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5  

## Python code

```python
class Solution:
    def findMedianSortedArrays(self, nums1: List[int], nums2:List[int]) -> float:
        l = len(nums1) + len(nums2)
        if l % 2 == 1:
            return self.kth(nums1, nums2, l//2)
        else:
            return (self.kth(nums1, nums2, l//2) + self.kth(nums1, nums2, l//2 - 1)) / 2

    def kth(self, a: List[int], b: List[int], k: int):
        if not a:
            return b[k]
        if not b:
            return a[k]
        ia, ib = len(a) // 2, len(b) // 2
        ma, mb = a[ia], b[ib]

        # when k is bigger than the sum of a and b's median indices
        if ia + ib < k:
            # if a's median is bigger than b's, b's first half doesn't include k
            if ma > mb:
                return self.kth(a, b[ib + 1:], k - ib - 1)
            else:
                return self.kth(a[ia + 1:], b, k - ia - 1)

        # when k is smaller than the sum of a and b's indices
        else:
            # if a's median is bigger than b's, a's second half doesn't include k
            if ma > mb:
                return self.kth(a[:ia], b, k)
            else:
                return self.kth(a, b[:ib], k)
```

## Explanation

>a = 7, 8, 9  
>b = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6  
>k = 4  
>k means the indice of the median of two sorted arrays

### step 1

|   |   |   |       | **k** |   |   |           |       |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-----:|:-----:|:-:|---|-----------|-------|
|   |   |   |       |       |   | 7 | ~~**8**~~ | ~~9~~ |
| 1 | 2 | 3 | **4** |   5   | 6 |   |           |       |

```python
a = [7, 8, 9]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
ia = 1
ib = 3
ma = 8
mb = 4
# K is less that the sum of two median indices,
# so we abandon the right portion of A divided by the median indice since K is definitely not in there.
# And we don't need to change K because it's index will not be affected by removing elements in the back.
kth([7], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 4)
```

### step 2

|   |   |   |       | **k** |   |       |   |   |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-----:|:-----:|:-:|-------|---|---|
|   |   |   |       |       |   | **7** |   |   |
| ~~1~~ | ~~2~~ | ~~3~~ | ~~**4**~~ |   5   | 6 |       |   |   |

```python
a = [7]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
ia = 0
ib = 3
ma = 7
mb = 4
# K is greater that the sum of two median indices,
# we abandon the left portion of B divided by the median indice as above.
# And we do need to change K now because K's index will be affected by removing previous elements.
kth([7], [5, 6], 0)
```

### step 3

| **k** |       |       |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|       |       | ~~**7**~~ |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   5   | **6** |       |   |   |   |   |   |   |

```python
a = [7]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
ia = 0
ib = 1
ma = 7
mb = 6
# K is less that the sum of two median indices again,
# we abandon the right portion of A divided by the median indice, which is A itself.
# So now we know K's index and which array that K hided in.
kth([], [5, 6], 0)
```

### result

```python
b[0] = 5
```
