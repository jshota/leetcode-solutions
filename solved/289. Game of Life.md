## Description

According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Wikipedia's article</a>: "The <b>Game of Life</b>, also known simply as <b>Life</b>, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a <i>board</i> with <i>m</i> by <i>n</i> cells, each cell has an initial state <i>live</i> (1) or <i>dead</i> (0). Each cell interacts with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood" target="_blank">eight neighbors</a> (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. <span>The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.</span>

<strong>Example:</strong>

<strong>Input:  </strong><span id="example-input-1-1"><code>[  [0,1,0],  [0,0,1],  [1,1,1],  [0,0,0]]</code></span>  
<strong>Output: </strong><span id="example-output-1"><code>[  [0,0,0],  [1,0,1],  [0,1,1],  [0,1,0]]</code></span>

<b>Follow up</b>:

1. Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
2. In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?

## Python code

```python
def gameOfLife(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> None:
    """
    Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
    """
    # live cell corrdinate
    live = {(i, j) for i, row in enumerate(board) for j, live in enumerate(row) if live}
    live = self.gameOfLifeInfinite(live)
    for i, row in enumerate(board):
        for j in range(len(row)):
            row[j] = int((i, j) in live)

def gameOfLifeInfinite(self, live: set) -> set:
    ctr = collections.Counter((I, J)
                                for i, j in live
                                for I in range(i-1, i+2)
                                for J in range(j-1, j+2)
                                if I !=i or J != j)
    return {ij
            for ij in ctr
            if ctr[ij] == 3 or ctr[ij] == 2 and ij in live}
```
