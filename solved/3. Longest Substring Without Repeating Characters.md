## Description

>Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
>
>>Example1:
>>
>>Input: "abcabcbb"
>>Output: 3
>>Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
>
>>Example2:
>>

## Python code

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        l = 0
        result = 0
        memo = {}
        for r, x in enumerate(s):
            if x in memo:
                l = max(l, memo[x] + 1)
            memo[x] = r
            res = max(r - l + 1, res)
```
