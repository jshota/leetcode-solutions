## Description

Merge <em>k</em> sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. Analyze and describe its complexity.

<strong>Example:</strong>

<strong>Input:</strong> <code>[1->4->5,  1->3->4,  2->6]</code>  
<strong>Output:</strong> <code>1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6</code>

## Python code

```python
def mergeKLists(self, lists):
    from heapq import heappush, heappop, heapreplace, heapify
    # Heaps are binary trees for which every parent node has a value less than or equal to any of its children
    # If two elements have the same val, the next tuple items will be compared:
    heap = [(head.val, i, head) for i, head in enumerate(lists) if head]
    # Transform list x into a heap, in-place, in linear time
    heapify(heap)

    dummy = ListNode(0)
    curr = dummy

    while heap != []:
        val, i, node = heap[0]
        if not node.next: # exhausted
            # Pop and return the smallest item from the heap
            heappop(heap)
        else:
            # Pop and return the smallest item from the heap, and also push the new item.
            heapreplace(heap, (node.next.val, i, node.next))
        curr.next = node
        curr = curr.next

    return dummy.next
```
