## Description

We have a list of <code>points</code> on the plane.  Find the <code>K</code> closest points to the origin <code>(0, 0)</code>.

(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)

You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)

 

<strong>Example 1:</strong>

<strong>Input: </strong>points = <span id="example-input-1-1"><code>[[1,3],[-2,2]]</code></span>, K = <span id="example-input-1-2">1</span>  
<strong>Output: </strong><span id="example-output-1"><code>[[-2,2]]</code></span>  
<strong>Explanation: </strong>The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just <code>[[-2,2]]</code>.

<strong>Example 2:</strong>

<strong>Input: </strong>points = <span id="example-input-2-1"><code>[[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]]</code></span>, K = <span id="example-input-2-2">2</span>  
<strong>Output: </strong><span id="example-output-2"><code>[[3,3],[-2,4]]</code></span>(The answer <code>[[-2,4],[3,3]]</code>would also be accepted.)

<strong>Note:</strong>

1. 1 <= K <= points.length <= 10000
2. -10000 < points[i][0] < 10000
3. -10000 < points[i][1] < 10000

## Python code

```python
def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], K: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    heap = []
    for (x, y) in points:
        # the opposite of the distance between two points
        dist = -(x*x + y*y)

        # reach the limit
        if len(heap) == K:
            # replace the tuple with the longest distance by the new tuple
            heapq.heappushpop(heap, (dist, x, y))

        # or not
        else:
            # insert the new tuple into the heap
            heapq.heappush(heap, (dist, x, y))

    return [(x, y) for (dist, x, y) in heap]
```
